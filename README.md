# Awesome Web Animation Players

Some tips & links for 3d & 2d animaition artists to get their works to be shown on the web, in no particular order:

### [Rive](https://rive.app/)
Interactive & timeline based animations that can be used anywhere: web, video game engines like Unity/Unreal, low-level players for C#, C++, React, Flutter.... Has become mature over the past few years.  Might be able to handle a full page webapp UX, or longer animations.

### Adobe AfterEffects -> [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/blog/working-with-lottie-animations/bodymovin-or-lottiefiles-for-after-effects)
Exports the vector files & animations as JSON to be used with players like [AirBnB's open source lotie player](https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/).  Seems the target use case is shorter & smaller flourishes.
The previous exporter was Bodymovin, which currently (2025-01) seems to not work in the current AfterEffects.

### [Blend4Web](https://www.blend4web.com/)
Free & commercial licenses to showcase [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) models.  Seems to allow some interaction & timeline animations, but hard to find good examples.

### [Marmoset](https://marmoset.co/toolbag/viewer/)
Looks to be a good 3d asset viewer, but seems to have a pricetag, though that pricetag includes the powerful 3d editor.  Web searches can bring up other similar online players & [3d Viewers](https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer); some are more niche than others.

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript/SVG
You can [use web technologies](https://github.com/sergey-pimenov/awesome-web-animation) directly themselves to create very rich animations for the web.  Sometimes only [CSS alone](https://codepen.io/collection/nrBROn?cursor=eyJwYWdlIjoyfQ==) is all you [need](https://github.com/Dev-Jeromebaek/awesome-web-styling).
Many [examples](https://codepen.io/search/pens?q=svg+animations) [online](https://youtu.be/u8YujK0jTSM?list=PLakykuPxo3cipvG2kDnDsictsxc0OdUMa).  Sometimes a library like [Motion](https://motion.dev/) or [GASP](https://gsap.com/) can help speed web animations.

### Video
Do a screen capture using your favorite app & post online.  You can have the browser auto-play the video only if the sound is off.  If you need to compose & don't mind some programming, [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) can turn web animations into MP4 videos, or use their player to play its ReactJS based files directly in the web browser.

### GIF
If the animation clip is short and small enough, why not go old-school?
